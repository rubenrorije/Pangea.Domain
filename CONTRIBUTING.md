#Contributing to Pangea.Domain
This project is a pet project of mine, but I would encourage you to participate. I enjoy having a robust test suite for all the code and expect this from contributions as well. To help with having a common coding style within the application I included multiple code analyzers into this project [C# Coding Guidelines] (https://csharpcodingguidelines.com/) and [FxCopAnalyzers](https://github.com/dotnet/roslyn-analyzers). 

In short please send me a pull request with:
- The [pull request](https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests) is targeted at the `master` branch.
- The code complies with the analyzers mentioned above.
- The pull request contains a detailed description of the changes and the rationale.
- The changes in the code are covered by unit tests.
