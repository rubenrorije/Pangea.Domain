# Pangea.Domain

A project containing multiple different value objects with extended behaviour, for example CreditCard, Percentage, Iban, etc. 
The repository is created because I like to have more explicit logic for the objects I am using and do not want to spread the logic around.

For example in most projects I worked on, I have created a DateRange object that is able to validate whether a given date was within a range.
